    """
    Create a learning curve to help us determine if we are overfitting or
    underfitting. This is a wrapper over sklearn's excellent learning_curve
    function that adds useful capabilities like multiple estimators and
    automatically creates a plot, hopefully reducing boilerplate code. Returns
    a matplotlib.pyplot object. Don't forget to call plt.show() if needed.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator: sklearn estimator object type that implements "fit" and "predict"
               as expected from sklearn, or array-like of estimator objects
               Use an array-like if you want to pass multiple estimators to the
               same plot. If passing multiple estimators, scoring must be
               specified.
    
    X: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
       Training vector, where n_samples is the number of samples and
       n_features is the number of features.
    
    y: array-like, shape (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_features), optional
       Target relative to X for classification or regression;
       None for unsupervised learning.
       
    ylim: tuple, shape (ymin, ymax), optional
          Defines min and max y-values plotted

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train/test splits.
        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.
    
    scoring: string, indicating sklearn scoring nickname from sklearn.metrics
        This will be the name of the y-axis on the returned plot if specified
    
    train_sizes: array-like, shape (n_ticks,), dtype float or int
        Relative or absolute numbers of training examples that will be used to
        generate the learning curve. If the dtype is float, it is regarded as a
        fraction of the maximum size of the training set (that is determined
        by the selected validation method), i.e. it has to be within (0, 1].
        Otherwise it is interpreted as absolute sizes of the training sets.
        Note that for classification the number of samples usually have to
        be big enough to contain at least one sample from each class.
        (default: np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 5))
    
    train_axis: string, either 'n_examples' or 'per_examples'
        Indicates what should be used on the x-axis of the returned plot.
    
    estimator_titles: array_like shape (n_estimators)
        Indicates the title for each estimator to be used in plotting and added
        to the legend. This is useful to distinguish between multiple models on
        the same learning curve. This should always be specified when using 
        multiple estimators on the same curve; otherwise, the plot will be hard
        to read. (default: None)

    n_jobs: integer, optional
            Number of jobs to run in parallel. (default: 1)

    Returns
    -------
    plt: matplotlib.pyplot object for further editing by user. Don't forget to
         use plt.show() or %matplotlib inline if necessary.
